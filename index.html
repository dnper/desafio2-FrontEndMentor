                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br>
                    were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br>
                    honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for <br>
                    the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br>
                    weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve <br>
                    successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br>
                    never written a line of code. I needed <br>
                    some structure from professionals <br>
                    who can help me learn programming <br>
                    step by step. I was encouraged to<br>
                    enroll by a former student of theirs<br>
                    who can only say wonderful things <br>
                    about the program. The entire <br>
                    curriculum and staff did not <br>
                    disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>
                    and I never had to wait long for <br>
                    assistance. The agile team project, in<br> 
                    particular, was outstanding. It took <br>
                    my learning to the next level in a way <br>
                    that no tutorial could ever have. In <br>
                    fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br>
                    interviews as an example of my <br>
                    developent experience. It certainly <br>
                    helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>
                    developer after receiving multiple <br>
                    offers. 100% recommend! ”
